    SELECT is the clause you use every time you want to query information from a database.

    WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.

    LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause

    AND and OR are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.

    ORDER BY lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.

    LIMIT lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.

AND genre = 'comedy';

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE genre = 'comedy'
OR year < 1980;
