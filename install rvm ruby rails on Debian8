how to install specific version of Ruby and Rails via RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

Since Debian8 does not host RVM package in official distro repository (it offers some old version of Rbenv instead),
we have to install it from app servers - only for specific user account (not system wide).

Log in as a user (rails server will be running with her system privileges)
Install gnupg2 package:
sudo apt-get install gnupg2
Import RVM's server keys:
curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg2 --import -
Install RVM:
curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
Load RVM: 
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
Install system speciffic dependencies for Ruby:
rvm requirements
Install specific version of Ruby:
rvm install x.y.z
Check Ruby version:
ruby -v
Install Bundler:
gem install bundler
Install specific version of Rails:
gem install rails -v x.y.z
(Debian8) Install 'node.js' dependency for 'uglyfier' gem:
sudo apt-get install nodejs
(Debian7) If you're installing on Debian7 you have to:
sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x | bash -
sudo apt-get install --yes nodejs
Application #
Install Git:
sudo apt-get install git
Clone application repository:
git clone <application-repository-url>
Go to application's directory:
cd <application-home-dir
Install gems:
bundle install
Initialize model/DB:
rake db:migrate
Start server (as daemon, detached from console) binded to specific IP address and port (defaults are: binding=localhost and port=3000):
rails server -d --binding=192.168.35.10 --port=8080
